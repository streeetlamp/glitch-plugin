# Bread Pudding

Loosely based on [jpweller's](https://github.com/jpweller) boilerplate.

## How To: 
Get your environment up to snuff
```bash
bundle install
```

Install node dependencies and whatnot
```bash
npm install
```

Run a few tasks to initialize everything
```bash
grunt init
```

Time to start the dev server
```bash
grunt dev
```

Work in the `app` directory. 

When ready for production use the build task.

```bash
grunt build
```

It will create a new `build` directory that is ready for deployment.

## Known Issues

If you're having imagemin issues make sure npm is up to date.

Check your NPM version

```bash 
npm -v
```

Update globally if needed

```bash
sudo npm update npm -g
```

```bash
                 ____
